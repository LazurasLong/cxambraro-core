Engine for visual novels or text quests on JS.

## Installing
Make following directory:
```js
game-name/
  img/
    bg/
      none.png
    char/
      none.png
  story/
    init.js
  game-name.html
```

It would be enough for browser version. If you are running game locally, copy folder core/ from repo.

Copy contents of index.html from repo into game-name.html (you can remove comments if you want). Launch and see nothing. Cool.

If you will use plugins (coming soon), add custom.js and custom.css into game-name/.
